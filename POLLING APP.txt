POLLING APP:
-> Still not clear with jwt tokens
-> Still not clear when to use module.exports or only exports
-> Not understanding 'populate' method

REDUX
Redux is a library for javscript applications
It is a state container. Stores the state of your application.
State of an app is the state represented by all the individual components of the app.
Redux is predicatble - what does predictable mean?
React-Redux is the official  Redux UI binding library for React	
Three concepts:
Store hold state of your application
Action these describe the change to the state of your application. It tell the reducer what to do and how to manipulate the states.

const exampleAction = {
	
	type: 'PERFORM_TASK',
	payload: 'Learn Redux'
}

Reducer actually carries out the state transition depending on the action. It takes current state and action as argument and returns new state.
